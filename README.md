These will be my forays into learning Python for data science. 

## Twitter Words Extractor

This code connects to the Twitter API and searches for tweets based on a
keyword provided by the user. It then gets the text of the tweets and counts
all the words (filtering the most common words like "of" or "the") and prints
a word count for the N most common words in tweets that match the search.
There is also an example of using the Twitter API to look up a users stream
and then search through their tweets to get their most commonly used words.
